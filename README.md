# Book-text-analysis
This project is built with the purpose of analysing changes that have happened in English literature over the years.

## Data Preparation
Took the 5 periods in English Literature and some famous books from each era.
Since the data was not available:
1. I took some books that were available in the gutenberg library.
2. The books from the post mordern era are still not available, for this I webscraped the available codes from good reads

## Code:
Using Knowledge graphs and HMM for implementation purpose
